## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The project initially seemed simple, but since I am currently learning React, I decided to develop it using React. I found it easier to perform validation using the 'useState' hook in React. However, as I am currently exploring the 'useReducer' hook, I decided to utilize it for my project, particularly for implementing live form validation. Now, the form aligns perfectly with my vision and goals for the project.

### Continued development

As I continue to progress in my journey of learning React, I plan to primarily focus on utilizing the useContext hook in my future projects. I firmly believe that learning by doing is the most effective approach to gaining a better understanding of complex concepts. By actively applying and experimenting with useContext, I aim to deepen my knowledge and proficiency in React development.
